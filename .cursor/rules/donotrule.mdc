Please do not change the layout I’ve already set. Maintain the current structure exactly as it is.
Instead, focus on improving the design — make it visually appealing, modern, and clean.
Use consistent spacing, good typography, balanced colors, and a minimalistic style.

Remember: No structural changes, only design improvements.
